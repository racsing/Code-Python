Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other.
Pythonâ€™s socket module provides an interface to the Berkeley sockets API.

A simple server-client program

Server call:
------------
bind() - binds it to a specific IP and port so that it can listen to incoming requests on that IP and port.
listen() - puts the server into listening mode. This allows the server to listen to incoming connections.
accept() - initiates a connection with the client


Client call:
------------
connect() - establish a connection to the server and initiate the three-way handshake.

Common methods:
---------------
socket() - create a socket object
close() - closes the connection
recv() - receive data / messages
send() - send data / messages
