# Day 1 : BMI Calculator

# Instructions
# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
# The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.
# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m)

# Warning you should convert the result to a whole number.

# Example Input
# weight = 80
# height = 1.75
# Example Output
# 80 รท (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837
# 26

#Solution

height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
weight = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))

bmi = weight / (height ** 2)

print('your body mass index is ' + str(round(bmi,2)) + 'kg/m^2')
